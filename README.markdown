## Description

The **emacs-mallard-snippets** repository provides Emacs snippets for the Mallard XML language according to [Mallard 1.0 DRAFT](http://projectmallard.org/1.0/index.html) as of 11 February 2013.

## Installation

**Important:** A working installation of the **YASnippet** template system for Emacs is required for these snippets to work. Refer to the [YASnippet repository](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet) for information on how to install, configure, and use it.

### Installing the Snippets Using package.el

To install the snippets by using the package.el package manager for Emacs, add the following lines to your **~/.emacs.d/init.el** to enable the Milkypostman's Emacs Lisp Package Archive (MELPA) repository:

    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
    (package-initialize)

Then run the following Emacs commands to install the **mallard-snippets** package:

    M-x package-refresh-contents
    M-x package-install mallard-snippets

### Installing the Snippets Manually

To install the snippets manually, change to the directory with your local copy of this repository and copy the **snippets/nxml-mode/** directory into the directory you configured for snippets. For example, to install the snippets to the **~/.emacs.d/snippets/** directory, type:

    cp -R snippets/nxml-mode/ ~/.emacs.d/snippets/

To load the snippets in Emacs, use the following Emacs command:

    M-x yas-reload-all
